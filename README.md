# Sherpa

Sherpa is a Go library for creating a [sherpa API](https://www.ueber.net/who/mjl/sherpa/).

This library makes it trivial to export Go functions as a  sherap API with an http.Handler.

Your API will automatically be documented: cmd/sherpadoc reads your Go source, and exports function and type comments as API documentation.

See the [documentation](https://godoc.org/bitbucket.org/mjl/sherpa).


## Examples

A public sherpa API: https://www.sherpadoc.org/#https://www.sherpadoc.org/example/

That web application is [sherpaweb](https://bitbucket.org/mjl/sherpaweb). It shows documentation for any sherpa API but also includes an API called Example for demo purposes.

[Ding](https://github.com/irias/ding/) is a more elaborate web application built with this library.

# todo

- finish the type information. perhaps add more specific types (int64, int32, and unsigned variants, instead of just "int").
- better error messages in sherpadoc
- handler: write tests
- sherpadoc: write tests
- client: write tests
- sherpadoc: find out which go constructs people want to use that aren't yet implemented by sherpadoc

- when reading types from other packages (imported packages), we only look at GOPATH. vendor and modules are not taking into account, but we should.
